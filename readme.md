# kdtree

This repo has the content regarding the presentation of KD-Tree that will take place at 'Universidad Distrital' contains slides, a simulation, and exercises regarding k-dimensional-tree. The repository is composed by:
 - sim: it has the my own implementation of kd-tree 'code.cpp' and the packages need to simulate; see after to learn how to run the simulation  
 - slides: coming soon


In the folder sim/ run the following command

```sh
 $ ./run.sh 10
```

where 10 means the number of pseudo random points that you want generate to see the behaviour of kd-tree.


## Example demo



## Dependencies

My own implementation has some problems regarding memory usage and maybe some bugs that I have not discovered yet, I'll really appreciate your pull request or comment.
